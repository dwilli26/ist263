            <h2>Mission & Values</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Mission:</strong><br>
                    To create a community where youth feel valued, have a vision for the future, a sense of self and community.
             </p>
            <strong>Values:</strong><br>
            •	Helping our youth achieve their full potential.<br>
            •	Providing engaging activities for youth around the key concepts of social emotional skills, vision of self, and community.<br>
            •	Connecting our neighborhoods through collaboration to ensure drug free, safe, healthy, and happy united communities.<br>
            •	Increasing bonding through attachment to family, community, and schools.<br>
            •	Reducing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use by building resiliency skills in our youth.<br>

            <h2>Communities That Care Program</h2>
            Bristol Cares was developed under the Communities that Care (CTC) model in partnership with the Prevention Research Center at Pennsylvania State University. CTC is a prevention-based program that aids communities in marshalling resources and coming together to do good for youth. Through the assessment of risk factors and drivers for behaviors such as drug-use, CTC organizations address community needs and develop initiatives to support adolescent development.
