                <h2>Communities That Care Program</h2>
                Bristol Cares was developed under the Communities that Care (CTC) model in partnership with the Prevention Research Center at Pennsylvania State University. CTC is a prevention-based program that aids communities in marshalling resources and coming together to do good for youth. Through the assessment of risk factors and drivers for behaviors such as drug-use, CTC organizations address community needs and develop initiatives to support adolescent development.
